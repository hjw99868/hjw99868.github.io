This is the first web crawler I have writen. It is very easy for someone who is familiar with web crawler. But it's a good program for a new comer.

If you want to learn web crawler, I think scrapy is a very good thing to learn first. Scrapy is an open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites ,fo course, in a fast, simple, yet extensible way. You only need to learn a little python before use scrapy. Here is a very good document of scrapy in [Chinese](http://scrapy-chs.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/0.24/intro/tutorial.html) or in [English](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html).
